            "Given this definition, we face a problem for neural networks with large parameter vectors $w$, wherein the sensitivity of the loss function $L(w)$ varies for each component. This means that having a single learning rate $\\alpha$ for all components of $w$ is far from ideal.\n",
            "\n",
            "To address this issue, we can introduce a $d \\times d$ matrix, $P$, called the preconditioner matrix. One important property of this matrix is that it's positive definite, which means that  $\\nabla _w L(w) \\cdot P \\nabla _w L(w) > 0$ which ensures that each step in the gradient descent process is still taken in the same direction as the previously defined gradient.\n",

            "One proposed extension of the RMSprop is to also track the mean of the gradient: $m_k = \\gamma_1 m_{k-1} + (1-\\gamma_1) g_k$. This proposed extension allows the convergence process to be more efficient. If the gradient is consistently pointing in the same direction, the learning rate is increased by the average. Alternatively, if the gradient is consistently changing direction, the learning rate is decreased by the average. The updated algorithm is:\n",

Since the moving averages of the mean and variance are initialized to zero, depending on the levels of $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$, the value of $m_k$ and $V_k$ can be close to zero. To address this issue, a final extension is proposed: \n",

For that reason, I'll set the embedding dimension to 20. This is a hyperparameter that can be adjusted to improve the model's performance. The output from the embedding layer will be averaged across the sequence dimension. This will result in a single *feature* vector for each document. A *sigmoid* activation function is then applied to the feature vector. This feature vector is then passed through a fully connected layer, which maps the feature vector to the output space which consists of logits corresponding to the two sentiment classes. \n",

Words that convey sentiment in the same direction but with different intensity would be positive but with a lower dot product. Words that convey sentiment in the opposite direction would have a negative dot product. Finally, comparing a word with sentimental value to a word with no sentimental value should result in a dot product close to zero."
