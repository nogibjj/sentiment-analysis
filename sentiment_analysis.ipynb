One important property of this matrix is that it's positive definite, which means that  $\\nabla _w L(w) \\cdot P \\nabla _w L(w) > 0$ which ensures that each step in the gradient descent process is still taken in the same direction as the previously defined gradient.\n",

This proposed extension allows the convergence process to be more efficient. If the gradient is consistently pointing in the same direction, the learning rate is increased by the average. Alternatively, if the gradient is consistently changing direction, the learning rate is decreased by the average. The updated algorithm is:\n",

For that reason, I'll set the embedding dimension to 20. This is a hyperparameter that can be adjusted to improve the model's performance. The output from the embedding layer will be averaged across the sequence dimension. This will result in a single *feature* vector for each document. A *sigmoid* activation function is then applied to the feature vector. This feature vector is then passed through a fully connected layer, which maps the feature vector to the output space which consists of logits corresponding to the two sentiment classes. \n",
